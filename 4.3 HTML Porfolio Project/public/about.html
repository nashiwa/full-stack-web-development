<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Software System at RWTH Aachen University, with an expected completion in October 2024. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Universit√§t Duisburg-Essen. My studies have equipped me with a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures, and algorithms, along with experience in database management systems. I am highly motivated to expand my knowledge and practical skills through ongoing learning and project involvement.</p>

<p>My professional journey has been geared towards becoming a full-stack developer. I have experience working as a Data Analyst at ALDI Einkauf SE & Co., where I contributed to digital transformation projects. Additionally, during my internship at Mavuno Technology GmbH, I applied machine learning techniques to improve agricultural yields, working with satellite imagery and data models. Through these roles, I have honed my skills in Python, Flask, Angular, and various databases, positioning myself for a full-stack development career.</p>

<p>Beyond my academic and professional interests, I am passionate about reading, traveling, and staying connected with nature. I love immersing myself in different cultures through travel and often find inspiration in books that offer new perspectives. Engaging with nature helps me find balance and fuels my creativity, whether it's through hiking or exploring new natural landscapes.</p>
